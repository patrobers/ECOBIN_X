IOT BASED SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING AI          

                                                      PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traditional waste management systems in rapidly urbanizing areas are increasingly ineffective due to their reliance on fixed collection schedules and manual monitoring, which ignore real-time bin status and dynamic waste generation patterns. This results in frequent overflows, premature collections of half-filled bins, increased operational costs, and severe environmental consequences such as air and soil pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and contamination of recyclable materials. A study in Mumbai revealed that up to 40% of collection routes serve nearly empty bins, indicating poor resource allocation and planning.
The lack of real-time monitoring and predictive analytics in current systems limits municipalities' ability to respond proactively to waste surges, particularly during public events or peak usage periods. To address these challenges, there is a critical need for an intelligent, automated solution that leverages IoT for live data acquisition and AI for forecasting and decision-making. Integrating these technologies can optimize collection routes, reduce environmental impact, and enhance resource efficiencyâ€”directly supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities), 12 (Responsible Consumption), 13 (Climate Action), and 14 (Life Below Water).
                                          
                                                       OBJECTIVES
1.	To create an AI-powered IoT waste management system that enhances waste detection and real time monitoring, classification, and collection efficiency, fostering sustainability and resource optimization
2.	To create a user-friendly dashboard enabling residents to monitor bin status, report issues, and access AI-driven waste disposal guidance. 
3.	To Reduce Collection Carbon Footprint by optimizing AI-based truck routes to cut fuel use.
